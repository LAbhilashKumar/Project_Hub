=======
Here is some more detailed information about the scripts I have written.  I do not consider myself a programmer, I create these little programs as experiments to have a play with the language, or to solve a problem for myself.  I would gladly accept pointers from others to improve the code and make it more efficient, or simplify the code.  If you would like to make any comments then please feel free to email me at craig@geekcomputers.co.uk.

In the scripts the comments etc are lined up correctly when they are viewed in Notepad++. This is what I use to code Python scripts.

batch_file_rename.py - This will batch rename a group of files in a given directory, once you pass the current and new extensions

create_dir_if_not_there.py - Checks to see if a directory exists in the users home directory, if not then create it

dir_test.py - Tests to see if the directory testdir exists, if not it will create the directory for you

env_check.py - This script will check to see if all of the environment variables I require are set

fileinfo.py - Show file information for a given file

folder_size.py - This will scan the current directory and all subdirectories and display the size.

logs.py - This script will search for all *.log files in the given directory, zip them using the program you specify and then date stamp them

move_files_over_x_days.py - This will move all the files from the src directory that are over 240 days old to the destination directory.

nslookup_check.py - This very simple script opens the file server_list.txt and the does an nslookup for each one to check the DNS entry

osinfo.py - Displays some information about the OS you are running this script on

ping_servers.py - This script will, depending on the arguments supplied will ping the servers associated with that application group.

ping_subnet.py - After supplying the first 3 octets it will scan the final range for available addresses

powerdown_startup.py - This goes through the server list and pings the machine, if it's up it will load the putty session, if its not it will notify you.

puttylogs.py - Zip up all the logs in the given directory

script_count.py - This scans my scripts directory and gives a count of the different types of scripts

script_listing.py - This will list all the files in the given directory, it will also go through all the subdirectories as well

testlines.py - This very simple script open a file and prints out 100 lines of whatever is set for the line variable
